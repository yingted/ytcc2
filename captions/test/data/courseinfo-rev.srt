1
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,613
- I'm gonna be talking about two courses.

2
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:11,950
The first is

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,630
CS 445

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,133
Software Requirement and Specification.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,113
It's the first course of the sequence,

6
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:24,640
the requirements course,

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,972
the three course sequence that teaches

8
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:29,754
about requirements specification,

9
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:33,123
implementation testing, enhancement

10
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:35,611
and management of software.

11
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,860
The first course is CS,

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,160
okay, if there's three course sequence,

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,330
you can take the same courses

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,000
in three different department.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,610
So since its CS, we're
talking about 445 first one.

16
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,630
The next one I'm going
to talk about is 446,

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,090
and then someone else I think

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,920
is gonna talk about 447.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,853
Next slide.

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,803
Okay, this course is about
Requirements Specification.

21
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,100
Requirement are the desired behavior

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,190
of systems that you want to build.

23
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,380
Software permanently.

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,320
What are we trying to accomplish?

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,950
And most importantly,

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,690
what does the customer want?

27
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,523
Next.

28
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:22,409
A specification is the description

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,020
of the proposed behavior of a system.

30
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,040
That is the description
of the requirement.

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,012
And it has the strength to question that,

32
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:36,500
"Can we build a software
system that meet our goal?

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,810
And what would that do?"

34
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,290
Now, an example of a specification,

35
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,350
we've all had programming assignments

36
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,023
that is specification.

37
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,323
Next.

38
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,723
Now, why an entire
course on specification?

39
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,200
Well, we've learned

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,500
that 80 to 85%

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,180
of all software errors

42
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,900
that are discovered at any time

43
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,930
during the life of a program,

44
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,363
can be traced back to bad requirement.

45
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:16,026
And we've also learned that
the cost to fix an error

46
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:17,609
grows exponentially

47
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:21,347
with the lifecycle stage.

48
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:23,000
So if you can fix it

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,790
when you're writing the requirement

50
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,800
it might cost maybe a couple of minutes.

51
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,880
By the time you wait

52
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,120
until the software has been delivered,

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,040
you're talking about hours and hours,

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,000
maybe weeks to fix the same problem,

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
because of all the other artifacts

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,340
that are now connected
to that requirement.

57
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,173
Next.

58
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,600
The course introduces students

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,560
to the requirements definition phase

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,590
of software development.

61
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,770
It discusses models, notations, processes

62
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,070
for software requirements identification,

63
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,000
representation, analysis

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,860
and validating them with the customer.

65
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,870
Now, the course is about how to elicit

66
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,510
discover, invent,

67
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,343
document,

68
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:10,810
validate, manage

69
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,920
and estimate the cost of requirements

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,640
for a computer based system.

71
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,020
Next.

72
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,050
The topics are:

73
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,750
Lifestyle models,

74
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,450
Requirements Modeling,

75
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,149
Requirements Elicitation

76
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,760
Requirements Analysis

77
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,410
Requirements Specifications

78
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,973
and Cost Estimation.

79
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,540
Now,

80
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,990
of course you need to study then

81
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,700
how you evaluate to

82
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,800
and how much work is involved.

83
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,300
40% of the course is

84
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,283
with,

85
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,370
for the course project.

86
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,627
A requirement specification
that you have to write

87
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:49,410
and to mark the size that leads up to it.

88
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,650
10% is the midterm

89
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,500
and 50% is the final exams

90
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,240
because it's also an engineering course

91
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,720
and they require 50% for final exam.

92
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,490
There are no graduate students here,

93
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,633
so we skip that.

94
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,790
In teams,

95
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,270
you will require
requirements specification

96
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,400
for some medium-sized system

97
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,290
that's the DVD Recorder.

98
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,607
Or this term for example

99
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:17,730
for by Direct Note Word Parters.

100
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,130
There will be several assignments

101
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,280
that relate to that

102
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,130
and help you get ready to do it

103
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,063
so you don't have to do
it all in the last week.

104
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,603
Okay, next.

105
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,090
The project will allow you

106
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,363
to apply the principles
we're teaching in the class.

107
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,053
Next.

108
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,290
Okay, now, this is
about the second course.

109
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,703
CS 446.

110
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,110
Its title is Software
Design and Architecture

111
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,215
and Project Management.

112
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:52,065
So it

113
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:56,230
usually follow Requirement Analysis

114
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,380
in a normal lifecycle.

115
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,970
So that impact can follow.

116
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,760
Okay, so this course has three names

117
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,697
depending on which department you're in.

118
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:10,190
We're in CS so we'll talk 446.

119
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,370
Next.

120
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,980
The course introduces
students to the design,

121
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,790
implementation and evaluation phases

122
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,360
of software development.

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,480
It discusses software development,

124
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,950
design processes,

125
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,100
methods, the notations,

126
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,210
for implementation of design,

127
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,300
evolution of design

128
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,010
and implementation

129
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,733
and the management of
all of these activities.

130
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,100
So the topics are:

131
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,437
Lifecycle models again,

132
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:44,840
always apply to this phase.

133
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,390
Modularity,

134
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,820
Architecture,

135
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,640
Design Notation and Processes,

136
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,030
Management and Cost Estimation

137
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,210
based on design rather than requirement

138
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,050
and Risk Management,

139
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,850
trying to prevent all those things

140
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,810
that could go wrong from killing you,

141
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,060
Implementation,

142
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,900
Integration and Configuration Management,

143
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,260
Evolution, Maintenance and Enhancement.

144
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,093
Okay.

145
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,433
Thank you.

146
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:17,850
Are there any questions about it?

147
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,707
In case you're worried,

148
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:23,003
all of these courses
have a heavy workload.

149
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,410
So don't be surprised.

150
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,263
But, you're gonna have fun.

151
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,267
Okay, because your TA's

152
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,053
and your professors
will be your customers.
